    * This Program consists of 9 Functions which performs different tasks as per MENU;
      Functions are as follows;
      1. input();   Takes the Input of Player Information from user
      2. output();  Shows the last input information of Player
      3. writeInFile(); Writes the Input information into the File "PlayersRecord.txt"
      4. searchInRecord();  Searches the information such as Game, PlayerName, PlayerId, DormNo., bedNo. etc. in the File "PlayersRecord.txt"
      5. deleteInRecord();  Deletes the Player's Record using either PlayerId or PlayerName
      6. countPlayersInGame(); Counts the Players Enrolled in different Games
      7. countPlayers();    Counts the No. of Players Records available in File(Database)
      8. showAllRecords();  Shows complete Player's Records
      9. clearCompleteDatabase(); Clears the complete Player's Record Database


    * In the File Parents Name is stored as pn+FirstName+_+LastName
      ex. Parents Name: Vinod Singh ; but in the File it is stored as pnVinod_Singh
    * Similarly Dorm No. is preceeded with "D"
      ex. Dorm No. 5, but in the File it is stored as D5
    * Similarly Bed No. is preceeded with "B"
      ex. Dorm No. 15, but in the File it is stored as B15
    * Similarly coach name is preceeded with "cn" ex. Coach Name is Sudhir Singh is cnSudhir_Singh
